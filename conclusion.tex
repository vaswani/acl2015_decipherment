\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We propose a new framework that simultaneously learns both mapping between word embeddings space and word to word translation. The approach takes advantages of two commonly used method: word vector based approach and decipherment. Experiment results show that our new algorithm improves decipherment accuracy significantly: from 22\% to 60\% for Spanish-English, and 5.8\% to 12.0\% for Malagasy-English. In the future, we will work on making the new method scale to much larger vocabulary size.
