\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We propose a new framework that simultaneously performs decipherment and learns mapping of word embeddings. The mapping is then used to give decipherment a better base distribution. Experiment results show that our new algorithm improves the state-of-the-art decipherment accuracy significantly: from 22\% to 60\% for Spanish-English, and 5.8\% to 12.0\% for Malagasy-English. The improvement could lead to further advances in using monolingual data for better quality MT
In the future, we will work on making the new method scale to much larger vocabulary size, and apply it to improve MT systems.
