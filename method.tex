\section{Method}
In this section, we will present our approach for learning the mapping between source and target vector spaces. Following \cite{mimno2012topic}, we will first derive the complete data log likelihood for our model and then present the steps of our stochastic EM algorithm. For a particular ciphertext and plaintext bigram, For an english word $\word{e}$,
