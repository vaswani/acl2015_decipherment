\section{Model Base Distribution with Word Context Similarities}
As shown in the previous section, the base distribution in Bayesian decipherment is given independent of the inference process. The easiest thing to do is to set it to uniform, which is the approach taken by all previous Bayesian decipherment work. We argue that a better base distribution can improve decipherment accuracy. Ideally, we should assign higher base distribution probabilities to word pairs that are similar.

One straightforward way is to consider orthographic similarities. This is true for close related languages. For instance, English word ``new'' is translated as ``neu'' in German, and ``nueva'' in Spanish. However, this fails when two languages are not close related, such as Chinese and English. There is a number of previous work that tries to discover translations from comparable data based on word context similarities. This is based on the assumption that words appear in similar context have similar meanings. The approach works very well in monolingual settings. However, when it comes to finding translations, one of the challenges is to draw a mapping between two different context space. In previous work, the mapping is usually learned from a seed lexicon.

More recently, there has been much work in learning distributional vectors for words, or word \emph{embeddings}. The most popular among these is those learned by the skip-gram and continuous-bag-of-words models~\cite{mikolov2013efficient}. In~\cite{mikolov2013distributed}, the authors were successfully able to learn word translations using linear transformations between the source and target word vector-spaces. However, unlike our learning setting, their approach relied on large amounts of translation pairs learned from \emph{parallel} data to train their linear transformations. Inspired by these approaches, we would like to exploit high quality word embeddings to help learn better posterior distributions in unsupervised decipherment. 

In the previous section, we set $\alpha_{\plain,\plain'}$ to to use our pre-trained language model. In the same vein, Following \cite{mimno2012topic}, we will first derive the complete data log likelihood for our model and then present the steps of our stochastic EM algorithm. For a particular ciphertext and plaintext bigram, For an english word $\word{e}$, 

We adopt the approach based on word context similarities to learn a better base distribution. However, our work is different from previous approach in the following ways: First, our work does not rely on any seed lexicon to learn the mapping between word context vectors, rather, it uses the results from sampling. Second, the mapping is not always fixed, but becomes better as the sampling process progresses. Last, but not least, the base distribution derived from the mapping and word contexts is used to improve decipherment.
